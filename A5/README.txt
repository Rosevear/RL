Q5 Part 1: -To generate the plot run python grid_exp.py
Q5 Part 2: -To generate a plot for a particular value of epsilon run python grid_sweep_exp.py -e {epsilon_value}. The default value is epsilon - 0.1
-All of the e_{epsilon_value}.png files are for different values of epsilon. The best epsilon plot is under Q5Part2, which is scaled down to view it better.
Q6: -To generate the plot run python grid_priority_exp.py
-The value of THETA is set in the experiment file, near the top.
